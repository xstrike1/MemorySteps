# MemorySteps

Application used to record and execute a series of mouse clicks and key presses.

Recording will store for each click:
 - The time in milliseconds until the next click
 - The position of the mouse cursor
 - A list of characters that have been pressed after the mouse click

configuration tab. After the press the form will disappear and the application will start
